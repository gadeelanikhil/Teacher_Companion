# Teacher_Companion

Long thing short: An Android Application which aims at reducing the manual work of teachers in creating presence lists.

This Application takes attendance and stores in the internal database
Unique features include: exporting the class details (Roll numbers,student names, dates and present/absent info) to an excel sheet,
taking attendance for more than once in the same day,
locking add class and class list activities with a pin to ensure no misuse by anyone else who is going through all the apps and browsing the data.
